# How to Activate Microsoft Office 2007 with a Confirmation Code
 
Microsoft Office 2007 is a suite of productivity applications that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. To use Office 2007 beyond the trial period of 30 to 60 days, you need to activate it with a valid product key. Activation is a process that verifies that your copy of Office is genuine and that you have not exceeded the number of installations allowed by the license agreement.

One way to activate Office 2007 is by using the Internet. The activation wizard automatically contacts the Microsoft licensing servers and validates your product key. If the activation is successful, you can start using Office 2007 without any restrictions.
 
Another way to activate Office 2007 is by using the telephone. This option is useful if you have problems with your Internet connection or if you prefer to speak to a customer service representative. The activation wizard gives you a toll-free number to call and an installation ID to provide. The customer service representative will then give you a confirmation code that you need to enter in the wizard to complete the activation.
